# Tronify - Built at Easy-A x Tron Hackathon
"Winning is Hard, Being Imposter is Easy."

It’s easy to pretend to be an imposter than go through struggles and achieve results. Often faking provides an undeserved advantage over genuine work. Organizations occasionally struggle to issue certificates or tickets for events they host. But since there are no authentication requirements and these certificates or tickets are not produced as NFT, they are simply faked. This program is a working prototype for an NFT-compatible certificate generator and validator built with TRON.

This specific use case is to validate the certificates to the participants, and winners at Tron x EasyA Hackathon. That’s not it, we built the system in such a way that after winning hackathons or competitions all the eligible participant’s prize money would be delivered to the recipients’ Tron Wallet. This would create a unique TxID that would be enclosed on the digital certificate which is hosted at the IPFS/BTFS, a decentralized storage system.

The digitally verified certificate is provided along with the NFT minted along on the ERC-721 which is TRC-721 compatible.
